This is an initial attempt at getting Alpaca code running on a Raspberry Pi that will allow the control of an OnStepX-based mount, as well as other peripherals.  
Hat tip to Claude.ai for code generation.  
At the moment (20251008) this is completely untested and this is serving as a repository for code generated to date.
Ie: this probably doesn't even come close to working ...
