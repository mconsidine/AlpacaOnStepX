**Architecture Pattern:**
```python
# 1. Create new class inheriting from Base
class NewDevice(BaseDevice):
    def connect(self): ...
    def specific_method(self): ...

# 2. Update factory function
def create_device(mode='auto', brand='zwo'):
    if brand == 'newbrand':
        return NewDevice(...)

# 3. Add to config.py
DEVICE_CONFIG = {
    'mode': 'newbrand',
    'newbrand': { settings... }
}
```

**That's it!** No changes to main.py or API routes needed.
