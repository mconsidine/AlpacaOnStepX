---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Mock Mode - No Hardware Needed)

### Step 1: Update Files

Copy these new files to your Pi:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/alpaca-onstepx/
# Copy: filterwheel.py, focuser.py, test_filterwheel_focuser.py
```

### Step 2: Update config.py

```python
# Enable the devices
DEVICES = {
    # ...existing devices...
    'filterwheel': {
        'enabled': True,  # ‚Üê Set to True
        # ...
    },
    'focuser': {
        'enabled': True,  # ‚Üê Set to True
        # ...
    }
}

# Set to mock mode for testing
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {
    'mode': 'mock',  # ‚Üê Use mock for now
    # ...
}

FOCUSER_CONFIG = {
    'mode': 'mock',  # ‚Üê Use mock for now
    # ...
}
```

### Step 3: Update main.py

1. Update imports at top:
```python
from filterwheel import create_filterwheel
from focuser import create_focuser
```

2. Replace `init_devices()` function with new version

3. Add FilterWheel & Focuser API routes

### Step 4: Test It!

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/alpaca-onstepx/
source venv/bin/activate

# Test filter wheel in mock mode
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py filterwheel mock

# Test focuser in mock mode
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py focuser mock

# Test both
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py both mock
```

**Expected Output:**
```

## üîß Setting Up Real ZWO Hardware

### Prerequisites

1. **Install ZWO SDK Libraries** (on Raspberry Pi):

```bash
# Download ZWO SDK from: https://www.zwoastro.com/downloads/
# Usually provided as .so files

# For Filter Wheel (EFW):
sudo cp libEFWFilter.so /usr/local/lib/
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libEFWFilter.so

# For Focuser (EAF):
sudo cp libEAFFocuser.so /usr/local/lib/
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libEAFFocuser.so

# Update library cache
sudo ldconfig
```

2. **Connect Hardware via USB**

3. **Check USB Permissions**:
```bash
# Add your user to dialout group
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

# Log out and back in for this to take effect
```

### Configuration

Update `config.py`:

```python
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {
    'mode': 'auto',  # ‚Üê Change from 'mock' to 'auto'
    
    'zwo': {
        'wheel_id': 0,  # First wheel (if you have multiple)
        'sdk_path': '/usr/local/lib/libEFWFilter.so',
    },
    
    # Customize your filter names:
    'filter_names': [
        "Red",           # Position 0
        "Green",         # Position 1
        "Blue",          # Position 2
        "Luminance",     # Position 3
        "H-Alpha",       # Position 4
        "OIII",          # Position 5
        "SII",           # Position 6
        "Clear"          # Position 7
    ],
    
    # Set focus offsets (adjust these for YOUR filters):
    'focus_offsets': [
        0,      # Red
        0,      # Green
        0,      # Blue
        0,      # Luminance
        50,     # H-Alpha (typically thicker)
        30,     # OIII
        40,     # SII
        0       # Clear
    ]
}

FOCUSER_CONFIG = {
    'mode': 'auto',  # ‚Üê Change from 'mock' to 'auto'
    
    'zwo': {
        'focuser_id': 0,  # First focuser
        'sdk_path': '/usr/local/lib/libEAFFocuser.so',
    },
    
    # Focuser settings
    'max_increment': 10000,  # Max single move
    'temperature_compensation': {
        'enabled': False,  # Enable if you want auto temp comp
        'coefficient': 0.0,  # Steps per degree C
    }
}
```

### Testing with Real Hardware

```bash
# Detect hardware
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py detect

# Test filter wheel (auto-detect ZWO or use mock)
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py filterwheel auto

# Test focuser (auto-detect ZWO or use mock)
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py focuser auto

# Test both
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py both auto
```

**Expected Output with Hardware:**
```
============================================================
Hardware Detection
============================================================

ZWO EFW SDK: ‚úì Available
ZWO EAF SDK: ‚úì Available

--- Detecting ZWO Filter Wheels ---
Found 1 filter wheel(s)

--- Detecting ZWO Focusers ---
Found 1 focuser(s)
```

## üéØ Configuration Modes Explained

### FilterWheel & Focuser Mode Options:

**`mode: 'auto'`** (Recommended)
- Try to use ZWO hardware if available
- Fall back to mock if hardware not found
- Best for development

**`mode: 'zwo'`**
- Only use ZWO hardware
- Error if hardware not found
- Best for production with known hardware

**`mode: 'mock'`**
- Always use simulation
- Good for testing without hardware
- Good for development

---

## üîÑ Switching Between Mock and Real

**Just change ONE line in config.py:**

```python
# For testing without hardware:
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'mock', ...}

# For automatic detection:
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'auto', ...}

# For hardware only:
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'zwo', ...}
```

No code changes needed! Just restart the server. üéâ

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Mock Test (No Hardware)
```bash
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py both mock
python main.py
# Test in N.I.N.A.
```

### Scenario 2: Partial Hardware (e.g., only focuser)
```python
# config.py
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'mock', ...}  # No physical wheel
FOCUSER_CONFIG = {'mode': 'auto', ...}       # Will use ZWO if found
```

### Scenario 3: All Real Hardware
```python
# config.py  
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'auto', ...}
FOCUSER_CONFIG = {'mode': 'auto', ...}
```

---

## ‚ùå Troubleshooting

### "ZWO SDK not available"

**Solution 1:** Install SDK libraries
```bash
# Check if libraries exist
ls -l /usr/local/lib/libEFW*.so
ls -l /usr/local/lib/libEAF*.so

# If missing, download from ZWO website
```

**Solution 2:** Use mock mode
```python
# config.py
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {'mode': 'mock', ...}
FOCUSER_CONFIG = {'mode': 'mock', ...}
```

### "No ZWO filter wheels found"

**Check 1:** Is it connected?
```bash
lsusb | grep ZWO
```

**Check 2:** Permissions
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
# Log out and back in
```

**Check 3:** Try detection script
```bash
python test_filterwheel_focuser.py detect
```

### "Failed to open filter wheel"

- Another program might be using it
- Try disconnecting/reconnecting USB
- Restart the Pi

### Mock Mode Not Working

This should always work! If it doesn't:
```bash
# Check imports
python3 -c "from filterwheel import MockFilterWheel"
python3 -c "from focuser import MockFocuser"
```

## üé® Customizing Filter Names & Offsets

### Example: Standard LRGB Setup

```python
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {
    'filter_names': [
        "Luminance",
        "Red",
        "Green",
        "Blue",
        "Clear",
        "Empty",
        "Empty",
        "Empty"
    ],
    
    'focus_offsets': [
        0,      # Luminance (reference)
        -20,    # Red
        10,     # Green
        15,     # Blue
        0,      # Clear
        0,      # Empty
        0,      # Empty
        0       # Empty
    ]
}
```

### Example: Narrowband Setup

```python
FILTERWHEEL_CONFIG = {
    'filter_names': [
        "H-Alpha",
        "H-Beta",
        "OIII",
        "SII",
        "Luminance",
        "Red",
        "Green",
        "Blue"
    ],
    
    'focus_offsets': [
        50,     # H-Alpha
        48,     # H-Beta
        30,     # OIII
        40,     # SII
        0,      # Luminance (reference)
        0,      # Red
        0,      # Green
        0       # Blue
    ]
}
```

**Pro Tip:** Run autofocus in N.I.N.A. for each filter to determine exact offsets!

## üîÆ Future Expansion

The architecture is ready for other brands:

### Adding Pegasus Astro FocusCube

```python
# focuser.py - add new class
class PegasusFocuser(FocuserBase):
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Update factory function
def create_focuser(mode='auto', brand='zwo', ...):
    if brand == 'pegasus':
        return PegasusFocuser(...)
    # ...
```

### Adding Manual FilterWheel

```python
# filterwheel.py
class ManualFilterWheel(FilterWheelBase):
    def set_position(self, position):
        # Prompt user to manually change filter
        print(f"Please set filter to position {position}")
        input("Press Enter when done...")
        return True
```

Same pattern for any hardware! üöÄ
